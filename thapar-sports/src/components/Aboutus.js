                            <p><b>Parents around the world face the difficult decision of letting their children pursue a career in
                                sports as the traditional education system is not flexible enough to balance both sports and
                                academics. This can take a toll on their academic qualifications or force them to quit their
                                sporting dreams. Identifying the persistence of this issue in India, The Sports Department was
                                established with a vision to integrate sports and education to encourage young sports enthusiasts
                                and support professional athletes.</b></p>
